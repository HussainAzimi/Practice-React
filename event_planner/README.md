## Function Component Event Planner Landing Page

 I create a basic landing page for an organization that plans personal and corporate events. this EventPlanner component project consists of various sections, such as the description of the application, event categories, features, testimonials, contact form, and footer. Each section describes various aspects of the Event Planner app, such as the types of events that can be planned, the app's main features, customer reviews, and how to get in touch with the service provider.  



## Conclusion

By doing this Project, I have learned to create a structured hierarchy of React components by creating a component called EventPlanner.

In addition, I learned how to create forms in React by adding a contact form to a component. This shows them how to combine form elements like textareas and input fields with a send button.

I used static content like titles, paragraphs, and list items in this component to give information about the event planning app and its features.
