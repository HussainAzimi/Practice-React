## A bout Todo List APP
The main objective of creating this App is practice with React.js

## Learning objectives
1. Create a simple Todo List application using React and add headings and     associated lists to organize tasks.

2. Manage the todo items ans delete specific headings and lists, provide basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.

3. Use React's useState hook to manage the state of the Todo List, including the list of headings and associated lists.

4. Use React's useState hook also to render the values dynamically.

## Conclusion

- I have learned how to manage state in a React functional component using the useState hook. State variables such as todos, headingInput, and listInput are used to maintain the state of the Todo List and user input fields.

- I have learned to render headings and associated lists based on the state maintained by React's useState hook.

- I have used code that implements event handling functions to add new headings and lists, and to handle changes in input fields. These functions update the state of the Todo List, triggering re-renders to reflect the changes in the UI.

- I have created a Todo List component that is well-structured, with separate sections for input fields, heading display, list display, and add list functionality. This modular structure enhances code readability and maintainability.
