## E-Commerce Data Rendering using React Toolkit

The main objective of this project is to practice React.js, I built a simple E-Commerce application using React and Redux, it displays a list of products with an "Add to Cart" button for each product, shows the items added to the cart, and it allows users to remove items from the cart. All this information is going to be globally available throughout the application using the Redux Toolkit.

## Learning objectives

- Integrate React components with Redux for state management
- Implement basic E-Commerce features such as adding items to the cart, removing items from the cart, and clearing the cart
- Practice composing multiple React components to build a cohesive user interface
