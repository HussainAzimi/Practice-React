# A bout Content Rating APP

the main objective of this app is to practice with react.js components.
This React component called 'ContentRating' where the component will let users rate material by clicking 'like' or 'dislike' buttons. When the component is rendered for the first time, both the like and dislike counts are set to zero. I created a method that changes the state to add one to the number of likes when a user selects the 'like' button. In the same way, clicking the 'dislike' button, the method will add one to the number of dislikes. This action lets users rate the content in an interactive way and provides useful input to content creators.

# Conclusion
In this lab, I have learned how to set up and create state variables in the constructor of a React class component. The state variables let the component handle and keep track of dynamic data like "likes" and "dislikes".

I have understood how to make arrow functions in the state of a component, which contains the code for changing certain state variables when the user does something like click a button.

Using event handling, I have learned how to connect these arrow functions to the onClick events on related UI elements in React.The functions let the state change dynamically based on user interaction.

I have also acquired the information to add dynamic state data to the rendered UI using the JSX markup. This shows the current counts of likes and dislikes along with descriptive content, giving users a complete way to rate content.
